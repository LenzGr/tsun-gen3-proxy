## [Unreleased]

- refactoring of the connection classes
- change user id on startup
- register MQTT topics to home assistant, even if we have multiple inverters

## [0.0.6] - 2023-10-03

- Bump aiomqtt to version 1.2.1
- Force MQTT registration when the home assistant has set the status to online again

## [0.0.5] - 2023-10-01

- Prepare for MQTT component != sensor
- Add MQTT origin
  
## [0.0.4] - 2023-09-30

- With this patch we ignore the setting 'suggested_area' in config.toml, because it makes no sense with multiple devices. We are looking for a better solution without combining all values into one area again in a later version.
  
‚ùóDue to the change from one device to multiple devices in the Home Assistant, the previous MQTT device should be deleted in the Home Assistant after the update to pre-release '0.0.4'. Afterwards, the proxy must be restarted again to ensure that the sub-devices are created completely.

### Added

- Register multiple devices at home-assistant instead of one for all measurements.
  Now we register: a Controller, the inverter and up to 4 input devices to home-assistant.
